h1. Matrix URL Title celltype

This celltype for Matrix on EE2 gives you the ability to create unique “URL Titles” within your Matrix fields.

h3. Requirements

* "ExpressionEngine 2":http://expressionengine.com/index.php?affiliate=brandonkelly&page=/public_beta/
* "Matrix":http://pixelandtonic.com/matrix 2.0.8 or later

h3. Installation

* Upload the ee2/third_party/matrix_url_title folder to system/expressionengine/third_party/
* Upload the themes/third_party/matrix_url_title folder to themes/third_party/
* Enable Matrix URL Title in Add-Ons → Fieldtypes

h3. Usage

h4. Here’s how you can give a URL Title to one of your Matrix fields:

* Edit your Matrix field in Admin → Channel Administration → Custom Channel Fields
* Click the “+” button beside your Matrix Configuration
* Set your new column’s Cell Type to “Matrix URL Title”
* Give your new column a name, such as “matrix_url_title”
* If you want your URL Title value to be automatically generated based on the value of another column, enter the “title” column’s Col Name into the “Title Col Name” setting

h4. Creating a “Single Row Page” using your URL Title

In ExpressionEngine, a “Single Entry Page” is where the first URL segment that doesn’t map to a template group or template name, does match an entry’s URL Title. ExpressionEngine will automatically return just that one entry within your @{exp:channel:entries}@ tags. (To get any other entries out of the tag, you have to add “@dynamic="no"@”.)

Matrix doesn’t have any sort of automatic “Single Row Page” display mode yet, but you can get it working yourself using Matrix’s @search:col_name=@ parameter.

Let’s say that your URL structure is like so: _/gallery/entry_url_title/matrix_row_url_title/_

In that case, @{segment_3}@ is going to be set to your Matrix URL Title. So to filter your Matrix row by whatever was entered into that URL segment, you’d do this:

@{matrix_field search:url_title_col_name="{segment_3}" limit="1"}@
